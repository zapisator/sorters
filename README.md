Here you will find the results of my exercises on learning and repeating sorting algorithms. Since I like uniform approaches, each sorting method has the same signature. This seemed to me to be the best way to learn anything: to bring everything to a common denominator. Now it always takes an array of integers as input. I am unlikely to change the type of input data and work with a more general type. That was not the purpose of the study. Not all kinds of sorting are here yet. I hope I'll get to the end of this study after all. I invite you to take a look at my work.
